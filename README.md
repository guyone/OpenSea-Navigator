# Reddit RCA OpenSea Navigator

**The RCA database is up-to-date as of gen5.**

Submit a OpenSea nft URL as a link post with the flair "Is This a Scam RCA?". The app will analyze the link and determine if it is a legit Reddit Collectable Avatar or not.

## Bugs

* This app does not determine if the link is an actual scam RCA. Just that it is **not** a RCA.

## Features To Add

* Determine if the RCA actually is a scam RCA.
* Let users submit a link from the Subreddit Menu instead of as a link post.
* Apply a Removal Reason instead of just a mod distiguished comment.
* store the reddit smart contracts to a cloud db or calls right to the blockchain to check.
